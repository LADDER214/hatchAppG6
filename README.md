# hatch-template-project - LADDERS

In this project we create a safe environment for domestic housework for women who are already working in that area in that area. This app will address the problems regarding the underpayment and the safety of these works. Furthermore it will introduce and provide courses for these women in order to increase their social mobility. 

This project was developed during [hatchlondon 2017](http://hatchlondon.io).

## Problem and Solution

Our target group (i.e. the people we are trying to help): female domestic workers living in urban slums in India
(This group can be expanded if the project were taken forward and scaled up)

### The Problem:
This group of people we are trying to help face major concerns in their daily work life
- they are doing undervalued/underpaid work, due the fact that most domestic work is carried out by women and therefore is not considered valuable
- potentially unsafe situations, where women are going to employers homes to fo housework/collect laundry without knowing much about who is hiring them
- little to no chance of social mobility, due to lack of access to skills training and/or education

All these concerns are inherently linked to The Problem of gender inequality in areas of poverty in India

### The Solution:
Th LADDERS App

This app is simultaneously a marketplace to source domestic work as well as a resource for finding and funding education/skills upgrading of domestic workers. Domestic workers can use the platform as a way to source work from nearby employers, those employers can then tip or give a bonus to a domestic worker they have employed, which will be put into a fund that the worker put towards paying for an online course or skills exam.
The app will partner with charities, universities and other educational organisations to provide skills advancement resources at a discounted rate. The app will also provide the employee users with personalised recommendations for courses they can take, based on their current work and future work preferences.
Both employees and employers will be able to provide anonymous feedback about each other, based on a number of factors (such as 'did you feel safe working for this employer' and 'did this employee arrive on time?'). This will add a level of safety and quality assurance for both employees and eployers.
